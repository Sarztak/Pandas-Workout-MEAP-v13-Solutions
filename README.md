# Pandas Workout Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book **Pandas Workout** by Dr. Reuven M. Lerner. This book has been an invaluable resource for enhancing my skills in data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library. Through the exercises, I have gained hands-on experience with various data wrangling techniques and learned to tackle real-world data challenges.

## What I Learned

### Data Handling and Cleaning
- **Confronting Real-World Data Challenges**: 
  - Worked with messy datasets that included human errors, inconsistent formats, and missing values.
  - Developed patience and problem-solving skills by navigating the complexities of real data.
  
- **Techniques for Handling Missing Data**:
  - Utilized methods such as `.isnull()`, `.notnull()`, `.fillna()`, and `.dropna()` to identify and manage missing values effectively.
  - Learned to use `.replace()` for mapping incorrect values to correct ones, enhancing data quality.

- **Data Fidelity**:
  - Understood the importance of maintaining high data fidelity and aligning datasets with the underlying data generation process.
  - Gained experience in cleaning data by filtering out human errors, such as typos and inconsistencies.

### Data Structures
- **Creating and Manipulating Series and DataFrames**:
  - Created Series from single-column CSV files using the `.squeeze()` method.
  - Constructed DataFrames using various methods, including lists of lists, dictionaries, and 2D NumPy arrays.
  
- **Data Selection and Filtering**:
  - Mastered selection techniques using `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]`, and boolean indexing to filter rows and columns.
  - Explored the differences between using `[]` for selection and the implications of using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`.

- **Transforming Data**:
  - Set new columns by transforming existing ones, enhancing the DataFrame's structure.
  - Appended multiple DataFrames using `pd.concat()` for efficient data management.

### Data Transformation and Aggregation
- **Method Chaining**:
  - Employed method chaining for complex data transformations, allowing for cleaner and more readable code.
  
- **Grouping and Aggregation**:
  - Gained proficiency in grouping data using `.groupby()` and applying multiple operations with `.agg()`, `.transform()`, and lambda functions.
  - Learned to filter grouped DataFrames using `.filter()` to extract relevant subsets of data.

- **Pivot Tables**:
  - Created pivot tables using `.pivot_table()` for better data summarization and analysis across multiple dimensions.

### Indexing and Multi-Indexing
- **Setting and Resetting Indexes**:
  - Learned to set and reset indexes, including multi-indexing for more complex data structures.
  - Utilized `.xs[]` and `pd.IndexSlice` for advanced slicing of multi-indexed data, enhancing data retrieval efficiency.

- **Sorting and Organizing Data**:
  - Explored techniques for sorting multi-indexed labels and preventing lexicographical sorting by setting the index to categorical types.

### Importing and Exporting Data
- **Reading and Writing Data**:
  - Gained proficiency in reading and writing data in various formats (CSV, JSON) with appropriate parameters such as `sep`, `index_col`, and `usecols`.
  - Explored techniques for reading data from the web using `requests` and decoding it with `StringIO`.

- **Handling Different Data Types**:
  - Learned to specify data types while importing data to optimize memory usage and improve performance.

### String Manipulation
- **String Methods and Accessors**:
  - Explored string methods and the `str` accessor for series containing string data, enhancing data manipulation capabilities.
  - Utilized regex for filtering and manipulating string data effectively, including methods like `.contains()` and `.split()`.

- **Creating Dummy Variables**:
  - Created dummy/indicator variables using `.get_dummies()` to facilitate categorical data analysis.

### Date and Time Handling
- **Working with Timestamps**:
  - Created and manipulated timestamps using `pd.to_datetime()`, understanding various date formats and how Pandas processes them automatically.
  - Extracted components from dates (days, months, years) and created periodic timestamps for time series analysis.

- **Date Parsing**:
  - Learned to parse dates from CSV files correctly, ensuring accurate data representation.

### Visualization
- **Data Visualization Techniques**:
  - Created various plots (pie, scatter, box, histogram) using Pandas' built-in plotting capabilities to visualize data effectively.
  - Utilized Seaborn for enhanced visualization options, including functions like `.relplot()`, `.catplot()`, and `.displot()` for more control over plotting.

### Performance Optimization
- **Memory Management**:
  - Checked memory usage with `.memory_usage()` and learned to specify data types to save memory.
  - Explored techniques for casting string data to categorical types using `.astype('category')

### Midway Project & Final Project
The culmination of my learning involved applying all the skills acquired throughout the exercises on a real dataset (Stack Overflow Survey results & US Department of Education survey). This project required merging, sorting, setting multiple indexes, and performing various cleaning tasks to extract meaningful insights.
